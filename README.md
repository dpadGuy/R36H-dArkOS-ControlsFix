# R36H-ControlsFix-dArkOS
R36H-dArkOS-ControlsFix aims to bring the conventional R36H controls from ArkOS over to dArkOs.
We use the R36H script from DeviceType which is from ArkOS in order to achieve the right hotkeys on dArkOS

# Menu Hotkeys:

**PPSSPP = R2 + L2**

**Drastic = L3**

**RetroArch = Select + X**
