# R36H-ControlsFix-dArkOS
R36H-dArkOS-ControlsFix aims to bring the conventional R36H controls from ArkOS over to dArkOs. (This also means assigning the right hotkeys)

For this we use R36H.sh script from DeviceType which originates from ArkOS in order to assign the right hotkeys for the R36H.

This should in theory also work on other consoles but i have not tested on others.

# Install Process
**Download the latest archive release which contains "DeviceType.zip", inside the archive you drag and drop the folder "DeviceType" inside "/roms/tools" or "EASYROMS/tools"**

**Over to your console you you go "Main Menu -> Options -> Tools -> DeviceType"**

**You then run "R36H"**

**You will be prompted if you wanna set device to R36H or not**

**Enjoy ^_^**

# Emulator Menu Hotkeys:

**PPSSPP = R2 + L2**

**Drastic = L3**

**RetroArch = Select + X**

# Restoring To Default Controls
**"Main Menu -> Options -> Advanced"**
